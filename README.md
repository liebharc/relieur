## Options:
-  -h, --help            show help message and exit
-  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT

The tool open the first file, and for each part, read and adds the measures of each the corresponding part in the next file. It remove the key and the clef of the first added measure if they are the same as the last ones of the previous file.
